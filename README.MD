## Some scripts for reading and analyzing data from the city of Boulderâ€™s open data catalog (<https://bouldercolorado.gov/open-data>). The goal is to make the data more accessible and easier for people to get started analyzing it.

A lot of the datasets available are spatial/GIS type data. I'm planning to visualize it with R following some of the nice tutorials from the folks at NEON: <http://neondataskills.org/R/open-shapefiles-in-R/>.
